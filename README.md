## 🚀 Project Details

### 1️⃣ Data Engineering (Building the Warehouse)
* **Data Architecture:** Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights. 🎯 This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:
* SQL Development Data Architect Data Engineering ETL Pipeline Developer Data Modeling Data Analytics
* **Datasets:** Access to the project dataset (csv files). SQL Server Express: Lightweight server for hosting your SQL database.
* **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** GUI for managing and interacting with databases.
* **Git Repository:** Set up a GitHub account and repository to manage, version, and collaborate on your code efficiently.
* **DrawIO:** Design data architecture, models, flows, and diagrams.
* **Project Requirements:** Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering) Objective. Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.
* **Specifications Data Sources:** Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* **Integration:** Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* **Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
* **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.


### 2️⃣ Data Analysis (BI & Reporting)
**Objective:** Leverage SQL to extract high-value insights regarding:
* 👤 **Customer Behavior:** Identification of high-value segments and retention patterns.
* 📦 **Product Performance:** Sales volume and profit margin analysis per category.
* 📈 **Sales Trends:** Period-over-period growth and performance forecasting.
